    "\n",
    "CANDO (Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities) is a shotgun, multiscale drug discovery, design, and repurposing platform intended to integrate multiomics data and a non-traditional multitargeting approach to effectively identify novel therapeutic uses for exisiting compounds and new chemical entities.\n",
    "\n",
    "![pipeline](figs/cando_pipeline.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The CANDO platform generally follows the following pipeline (as shown in the figure above):\n",
    "1. Extract, create, or \"select\" a library of proteins (or any macromolecular targets, e.g., RNA, etc.)\n",
    "2. Extract, create, or \"select\" a library of chemical compounds (approved drugs, investigational compounds, new designs, etc.)\n",
    "3. Extract, create, or \"select\" a mapping of drugs to effects, e.g., therapeutic effects, adverse drug reactions, etc.\n",
    "4. Choose an interaction scoring protocol and apply it to all compound-protein pairs between our two libraries.\n",
    "5. Collect and curate all interaction scores into compound-protein matrix where each row represents a compounds-protein signature. \n",
    "6. Compare all signatures to one another to determine compound similarity based on proteomic level behavior.\n",
    "7. Predict new compound effects using known drug effects and proteomic based similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The above pipeline is A LOT so we will go through each step and run the corresponding code to better understand how CANDO works and how you can apply it to your drug discovery project.*\n"

    "### Run generate_matrix()\n",
    "This is the function within CANDO that runs BANDOCK.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `generate_matrix()` first creates a dataframe for all chemical fingerprint similarity scores comparing each compound in the specified version library `v` (or only approved drugs with `approved_only=True`) to every potential binding site ligand from the PDB using RDKit to compute the chemical fingerprints in which `fp` denotes the type/radius of fingerprint (rd_ecfp4, rd_ecfp8, etc). The vector type, `vect`, can be binary (\"1024_bit\" or \"2048_bit\") or integer (\"int\") and denote the presence or absence or count of molecular substructures in the molecule, respectively. If using integer vectors, `dist` should be set to \"dice\", but binary vectors can be set to Tanimoto (\"tani\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, it creates a dataframe of all potential binding sites for each protein in the specified protein library, `protlib`, with their corresponding binding site scores from the specified binding site prediction method, `bs` (\"coach\", \"cof\", \"ssite\", \"tms\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "The function then iterates over all drugs and protein binding sites to populate the matrix with the best score based on the following input parameters: \n",
    "1. `i_score` - the scoring protocol of choice, which can be 'C', 'dC', 'P', 'CxP', 'dCxP', where C is the fingerprint similarity score (either Tanimoto or Sorenson-Dice coefficient), dC is the percentile of the C score for the compound compared to all ligands in the library, and P is binding site score associated with the ligand predicted by the [COACH algorithm](https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/COACH/)\n",
    "2. `c_cutoff` and `p_cutoff` - set cutoffs which ignore any C or P scores below each threshold, respectively\n",
    "3. `percentile_cutoff` - similar to `c_cutoff` but with the dC score (overrides `c_cutoff` if not `None`). These scores serve as a proxy for binding strength/probability of the drug and protein target. We then output the matrix to a tsv file, `out_file`, which in this case is \"tutorial_matrix-all.tsv\" (`out_path` can be set to write the file to a specific directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a matrix using the 'CxP' protocol, which just chooses the top Dice score to any ligand predicted to bind to a given protein, without any cutoffs. This function is parallelized, so setting the variable `ncpus` will change the number of processors that are used for this function. NOTE: percentile cutoff protocols ('dC', 'dCxP') take much longer to compute than 'C' and 'P' protocols. \n",

The distance metric used, `dist_metric`, can be cosine, RMSD, or many other common distance metrics (default is RMSD). This can be relatively time consuming depending on the amount of proteins, but with proteins on the order of hundreds it shouldn't take longer than a minute or two. If the computation does take a while (let's say >100,000 proteins), you can add a `save_dists='name_of_dist_file.tsv'` flag to save the computation. Then, simply use the `read_dists='name_of_dist_file.tsv'` to read in the already computed distances to save time. \n",

    "Sometimes there are no drugs associated with an indication (whether it be in reality or in your input indication mapping); in those cases we can use the `canpredict_denovo()` function to suggest putative candidates. Basically, this function counts/sums the number of protein interaction scores above a set threshold for each compound and ranks them according to frequency and strength. This is particularly useful for pathogen proteomes (like SARS-CoV-2 or bacterial proteomes) or for finding which compounds target a subset of proteins of interest (e.g. kinases). In our case, we have a diverse set of proteins, which would render the results meaningless. Instead, we can input a list of protein IDs in which we are interested. We have precompiled a list of bacterial proteins already present in the sample matrix for convenience. Note: if we had read in an indication-genes mapping file, we could use the `ind_id=` parameter to automatically select all proteins associated with said indication. "
